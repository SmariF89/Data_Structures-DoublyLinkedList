# Data_Structures-DoublyLinkedList
A simple doubly linked list.

A C++ class which implements a doubly linked list using pointers. The list itself is a C++ class but its nodes are plain old structs. Each node contains some data which, in this case, is a simple string.

The list implements the most basic and desired methods which a doubly linked list should contain, such as clear, insert, remove, append, get_value and length. Additionally, it also implements an overload of the cout (<<) operator in order to easily print the list's contents.
